# weather-dashboard

User Story
As a traveler
I want to be able to see what the weather will be like in cities around the world
I want to know what the future forecast will be in the cities I am travelling to
So I will go to this weather dashboard to check out the weather across the world

This project was a good test of my knowledge to create an application from scratch and testing our knowledge of API calls.

The challenges in this project were the little things like creating the cards to act correctly by getting the correct date and adding color to the UV index. Reading documentation was really helpful for these items though and I did learn a lot about this. I also really like using CSS frameworks like bootstrap which get some of the dirty work done faster and cleaner.
